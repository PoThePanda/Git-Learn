4.	git checkout –b 	<new_branch_name>
it creates a new branch and switch to that branch
5.	git merge    <branch1>   <branch2>
usually branch2 is merged into branch1

git merge will also include the currently checked-out branch in the merged version.
So if you have branch1 checked out, and you run git merge branch2 branch3, the merged version will combine branch1 as well as branch2 and branch3.
That's because the branch1 label will update after you make the merge commit, so it’s unlikely that you didn’t want the changes from branch1 included in the merge.
For this reason, you should always checkout one of the two branches you’re planning on merging before doing the merge. 
Which one you should check out depends on which branch label you want to point to the new commit.
