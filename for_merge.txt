i create this .txt file  in create_for_merge branch

and I'm going to run git merge second_branch create_for_merge

after  git merge second_branch create_for_merge

this file appears in second_branch


and the create_for_merge branch still exist

this is create_for_merge branch!

if you use git merge <branch1> <branch2> 
remeber to push the commit(auto created by git) to origin , so that the remote can be update

it's second_branch!
