git reset --hard HEAD^^

will  reset your files back to the time at commit HEAD^^

all the files you've changed and commit after HEAD^^ are discard(deleted)
( a little bit like git checkout HEAD^^ , but what makes reset --hard HEAD^^ different is that it deletes all the changes, including commit, and checkout HEAD^^ is temporary jumping back to the commit HEAD^^)


so make sure you are really going to delete those before you give this command
